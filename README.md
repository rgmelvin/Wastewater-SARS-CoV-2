# Wastewater-SARS-CoV-2
Time series analysis and prediction for wastewater SARS-CoV-2 levels

Goals of this prject are:

1. Use historical qRT-PCR data and Melvin's Index to test the predictive value of wastewater pathogen monitoring.
    a. SARS-CoV-2 is used as a test case.
2. Test Melvin's Index against the use of raw Ct-values
3. Test correlation of wastewater SARS-CoV-2 levels with reported case numbers.

Technology used:
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Google Colab
4. fbProphet
5. Initial data compilation and calculation of Melvin's Index was done using JMP and R.
